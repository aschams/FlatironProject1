## Purpose of our repository
The purpose of this analysis is to better understand the movie industry. We are specially interested in looking at what movies or types of movies should be made by a new studio/company trying to get into the film industry. We are therefore looking at films from the past 9 years (2010-2018) with the hopes of identifying key trend to allow a nascent production company become successful.
